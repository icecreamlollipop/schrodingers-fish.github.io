                    <br>
                    <p>Stoicism is a philosophy that originated in the Hellenistic period, founded in Greece by Zeno of</p>
                    <p>Citium in Athens. The most famous Stoics today, however, are all from the Roman Empire: Seneca,</p>
                    <p>Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. Although the philosophy originated in Greece, it gained popularity</p>
                    <p>in Rome starting around the Late Republican period. <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html" target="_blank"><i>Meditations</i></a> by Marcus Aurelius is one of the</p>
                    <p>most famous books on Stoicism, and remains popular even today.</p>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <p>The basic idea of stoicism is that destructive emotions (including fear, envy, regret, sadness,</p>
                    <p>anger, and much more) arise from false judgements. A "sage" is someone who has achieved moral </p>
                    <p>and intellectual perfection, and they would not experience such destructive emotions; they would </p>
                    <p>always possess a peaceful state of mind. Despite the name, this does not mean the Stoics were</p>
                    <p>against all display of emotion. It is the excess of unreasonable and destructive emotion that is</p>
                    <p>undesirable. The 3 main fields of Stoicism are Physics, Logic, and Ethics.</p>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>One of the most important things in Stoicism is the ability to differentiate between what is </p>
                    <p>physically within our control, and what is not. The idea is to focus on changing what we are able </p>
                    <p>to change, and to stop languishing over the things we can't change. No amount of wishing, sadness,</p>
                    <p>or anger will be able to influence things beyond our complete control: the weather, disease, war,</p>
                    <p>the past, other people's actions and decisions, the circumstances we are born into, and more.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is why we must focus on what we actually do have control over: our own emotions, actions,</p>
                    <p>desires, beliefs, and basically anything which exists within our own minds, because this is the</p>
                    <p>only way to alleviate our suffering. One of my favorite quotes that embodies this idea very well is</p>
                    <p>by Seneca: "We are often more frightened than hurt; and we suffer more from imagination than</p>
                    <p>from imagination than from reality."</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>The other part of Stoic Physics is perhaps much less applicable to daily life, as well as not entirely</p>
                    <p>accurate according to the laws of physics and cosmology that we know today. For instance, the  </p>
                    <p>Stoics believed there were four elements: fire, air, water, and earth, and that fire and air are </p>
                    <p>the elements which combine to create life. This is rather obviously incorrect, based on what we  </p>
                    <p>know about chemistry nowadays.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Stoics also believed that the Universe was cyclical and eternal; the world repeatedly creates</p>
                    <p>itself from nothing, destroys itself, and repeats this cycle forever. This is in fact one of the theories</p>
                    <p>on the universe in the field of cosmology; however, the world is unlikely to collapse and repeat</p>
                    <p>the Big Bang an indefinite number of times due to the Second Law of Thermodynamics (which</p>
                    <p>states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time), so the cycle must</p>
                    <p>eventually stop at some point.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Another interesting belief is that the Universe itself is in fact God. The Stoics did not differentiate</p>
                    <p>much between the Universe, God, Nature, Fate, or Reason. Everything is subject to Fate, so the</p>
                    <p>ultimate goal of life is to live according to Fate. This aspect of Stoic Physics intersects with Stoic</p>
                    <p>Logic and Stoic Ethics quite a bit.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>A passion is an illogical impulse that leads to intense distress. For instance, if you had a fear of dogs,</p>
                    <p> you may want to run away from a harmless, blind puppy, even if it couldn't harm you. Or perhaps </p>
                    <p>you feel a passion for too much alcohol, even as it harms your body. The thing that all passions have</p>
                    <p> in common is that there is always a false judgement involved. One of the goals of Stoicism is to</p>
                    <p>obtain freedom from passions through mastery of reason and logic.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Determinism is the belief that given certain circumstances, things must turn out a certain way,</p>
                    <p>according to what is reasonable. It is impossible for things to turn out any other way. For example,</p>
                    <p> if you were running on extremely slippery ice, and your coordination skills are absolutely terrible,</p>
                    <p> and you happen to slip (which is very likely, and is a very reasonable thing to happen given these</p>
                    <p> circumstances), then it is inevitable that you will fall down.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>According to Determinism, every single thing in the present can be fully explained by things that</p>
                    <p>happened in the past. Of course, chance and luck are things the stoics took into consideration as</p>
                    <p>well, but they thought this was merely another example of human ignorance. Is the number on a</p>
                    <p>thrown die truly random, or do we just not know enough about the physics of how dice fall? The</p>
                    <p>Stoics would say the latter.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>The scope of Stoic logic consists of not only what people nowadays call logic, but also the philosophy</p>
                    <p>of language, cognitive science, and epistemology. The Stoics made many contributions to</p>
                    <p>propositional logic, including the usage of propositional negation, conjunction, disjunction, </p>
                    <p>conditionals, <i>modus ponens, modus tollens,</i> and much more.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Stoics distinguished between "sayables" and "assertibles". A sayable is a very broad category,</p>
                    <p>which included assertibles, questions, imperatives, and much more. On the other hand, an </p>
                    <p>assertible is extremely similar to what we now call propositions.</p>

                    <p>The Stoics believed that the goal of life was happiness. But what is happiness? A happy life is one</p>
                    <p>which is lived in accordance with the reason in nature. Living any other way leads to unhappiness,</p>
                    <p>evil, and ignorance. It is also important to distinguish between things which are good, bad, and</p>
                    <p>indifferent, and we must strive to obtain the things which are good, because it is both necessary</p>
                    <p>and sufficient for happiness.</p>

                    <p>An objectively good thing must benefit its possessor under all circumstances. This is why wealth</p>
                    <p>is not necessarily always good; someone who is rich may spend it on harmful substances, and</p>
                    <p>overindulge in alcohol or drugs. However, wealth is not inherently bad either, since it does not</p>
                    <p>always prevent people from doing good, unlike traits such as greed, malice, anger, or ignorance.</p>
                    <p>Since it is neither good nor bad, it is instead called an "indifferent". So in the end, what things are</p>
                    <p>truly good?</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Among all the good virtues humans could possess, the Stoics focused on four: wisdom, morality,</p>
                    <p>courage, and self-discipline. Of all these virtues, the most important one is wisdom: the ability to</p>
                    <p> differentiate between good, bad, and indifferent things, and the ability to reason. The root of evil</p>
                    <p>and unhappiness was believed to be ignorance. For instance, if someone is evil and harms others </p>
                    <p>without justification, it is because they are ignorant of how to act good. Similarly, if someone</p>
                    <p>mistreats you, the anger you feel is due to your ignorance of how to control your emotions and</p>
                    <p>stay calm.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The next virtue, morality, is sometimes also translated as justice. It focuses on how we treat other </p>
                    <p>people, and involves concepts such as piety, kindness, fairness, and more. Most importantly, it</p>
                    <p>focuses on goodwill towards others. The third virtue, courage, includes not only bravery but</p>
                    <p>also the ability to endure pain and hardships. The last virtue is self-discipline, or moderation,</p>
                    <p>which is rather self-explanatory.</p>
